# League of Legends Analysis

by Zachary Hartman

## Introduction

League of Legends (LOL) is a popular online video game, where teams of five players play against each other. The dataset I will use has data from 2022 from professional matches. The dataset has many different statistics from individual data to team data.
In this project I will focus on team data. Specifically, I will use this team data to investigate my main question, how does this data allow us to make predictions about the outcome of matches.
The dataset has a total of 150,588 rows, which includes both teams and players. Of those rows, only 127,872 are complete. The only data I am interested in is the data for each team, so the number of rows is reduced to 25,098 rows, and 21,312 complete rows. The dataset also has 164 columns, but my investigation is only concerned with 10 of those columns, with 2 additional columns used only to study missingness. Here is an introduction to these rows:

- `result`: A column where 1 indicates that a team won, and 0 indicates that a team lost
- `totalgold`: Total gold generated by the team during the match
- `total_cs`: Total number of minions and monsters killed by the team during the match
- `goldat20`: The amount of gold generated by the team 20 minutes into the match
- `csat20`: The number of minions and monsters killed by the team 20 minutes into the match
- `killsat20`: The number of kills by the team 20 minutes into the match
- `xpat20`: The amount of experience gained by the team 20 minutes into the match
- `golddiffat20`: The difference in gold generated between the two teams 20 minutes into the match
- `csdiffat20`: The difference in the number of minions and monsters killed by the two teams 20 minutes into the match
- `xpdiffat20`: The difference in the amount of experience gained by the two teams 20 minutes into the match

The following columns will not be used in the hypothesis test or the prediction model, but will be used to test missingness.
- `firstbloodassist`: Whether or not the player assisted the first kill of the match
- `datacompleteness`: Whether or not the data for the match is complete. complete indicates the data is complete, and partial indicate the data is incomplete

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

During the cleaning process, I keep only the rows corresponding to teams, as they contain all the data I am interested in. In addition to that, I only keep rows where the data is complete, which, as mentioned before, is still a large amount of data and more than enough to complete my analysis. I replace the column `result` with the column `win`, which represents the same information, but `win` represents the outcome of the game as a boolean,  where True indicates that a team won, and False indicates that a team lost. The outcome being represented as a boolean makes the information easier to see at a glance.
This is the head of my cleaned Dataframe:

| win   |   totalgold |   total_cs |   goldat20 |   csat20 |   killsat20 |   xpat20 |   golddiffat20 |   csdiffat20 |   xpdiffat20 |
|:------|------------:|-----------:|-----------:|---------:|------------:|---------:|---------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| False |       47070 |        840 |      31962 |      631 |           5 |    36874 |           -944 |          -84 |        -4947 |
| True  |       52617 |        976 |      32906 |      715 |           7 |    41821 |            944 |           84 |         4947 |
| False |       57629 |       1209 |      31228 |      710 |           1 |    38596 |          -5140 |          -48 |        -3473 |
| True  |       71004 |       1257 |      36368 |      758 |           5 |    42069 |           5140 |           48 |         3473 |
| True  |       62868 |       1143 |      33717 |      752 |           3 |    41577 |           1744 |           14 |         2286 |

Note: `firstbloodassist` and `datacompleteness` are not included in this dataframe as they are not used in the hypothesis testing or prediction model, but will be used to study missingness.

I performed a univariate analysis on `total_cs`:

The histogram shows the distribution of total minion and monster kills. The distribution peaks at the range 950-999, and the distribution is somewhat concentrated around that range.
