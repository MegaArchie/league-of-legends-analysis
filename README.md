## Introduction

League of Legends (LOL) is a popular online video game, where teams of five players play against each other. The dataset I will use has data from 2022 from professional matches. The dataset has many different statistics from individual data to team data. In this project I will focus on team data. Specifically, I will investigate how this team data will allow us to predict the outcome of matches.
