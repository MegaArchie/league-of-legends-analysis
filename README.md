# League of Legends Analysis

by Zachary Hartman

## Introduction

League of Legends (LOL) is a popular online video game, where teams of five players play against each other. The dataset I will use has data from 2022 from professional matches. The dataset has many different statistics from individual data to team data.
In this project I will focus on team data. Specifically, I will use this team data to investigate my main question, how does this data allow us to make predictions about the outcome of matches.
The dataset has a total of 150,588 rows, which includes both teams and players. Of those rows, only 127,872 are complete. The only data I am interested in is the data for each team, so the number of rows is reduced to 25,098 rows, and 21,312 complete rows. The dataset also has 164 columns, but my investigation is only concerned with 10 of those columns, with 2 additional columns used only to study missingness. Here is an introduction to these rows:

- `win`: A boolean column, where True indicates a win, and False indicates a loss
- `totalgold`: Total gold generated by the team during the match
- `total_cs`: Total number of minions and monsters killed by the team during the match
- `goldat20`: The amount of gold generated by the team 20 minutes into the match
- `csat20`: The number of minions and monsters killed by the team 20 minutes into the match
- `killsat20`: The number of kills by the team 20 minutes into the match
- `xpat20`: The amount of experience gained by the team 20 minutes into the match
- `golddiffat20`: The difference in gold generated between the two teams 20 minutes into the match
- `csdiffat20`: The difference in the number of minions and monsters killed by the two teams 20 minutes into the match
- `xpdiffat20`: The difference in the amount of experience gained by the two teams 20 minutes into the match
- `firstbloodassist`: Whether or not the player assisted the first kill of the match
- `datacompleteness`: Whether or not the data for the match is complete. complete indicates the data is complete, and partial indicate the data is incomplete
